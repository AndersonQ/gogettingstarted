Goroutines one of the features that make Go so awesome! It's easier to explain
them showing and running examples, so to make it easier we'll use the go tool
[`present`](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/present)


To render the presentation:
1. have go present `golang.org/x/tools/present` (`go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present`)
3. `present` or `$GOPATH/bin/present`
4. Open your web browser on [http://127.0.0.1:3999](http://127.0.0.1:3999)
